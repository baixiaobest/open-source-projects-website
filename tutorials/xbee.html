				<h1>Xbee Tutorial</h1>
				<figure><img width="200" height="200" src="../images/main_page/xbee.png"><figure>
				<p class="intro">This is my first tutorial on xBee. I will be introducing the basics of configuring xBee radio module, different xBee network configurations, interfacing it with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and file transfer from computer to Raspberry Pi with xBee.<p>
				<h2 class="subTitle">What is xBee?</h2>
				<p>xBee is popular wireless transceiver module. It is highly easy to use,you can transmit and receive data through <em>serial port</em>. So that it can be easily connected to Arduino or computers with simple wiring. Also, it is simple to configure at you will, you can even create your own complicated personal <em>wireless network</em> with few xBees modules; or just a network as simple as a pair of xBees exchanging data.</p>
				
				<h2 class="SubTitle">xBee Networks</h2>
				<p>As I had mentioned, xBee can be setup as various network topologies. This simplest network is a pair of xBee.</p>

				<figure><img width="100%" src="http://examples.digi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/XBeeSimpleChatDiagram.jpg" alt="baixiao xBee pair"><img>

				</figure>

				<p>This setup is very useful when you want one to one control. For example, when you control a RC car, you want one end (RC car) to be dedicated to listening only to your controller end; and you want the  controller only to send data to your RC car.<br/><br/>
				Another useful network topology is STAR Network or Broadcast Network.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>In the setup, the coordinator(yellow) node is configured to send messages to all four end devices in red. This is more like a radio station, the yellow node is the station, and end devices are listeners. But what it is different from the radio station is that all the end devices can also send data to the coordinator.<br/><br/> 
				This network can be used for monitoring multiple sensors at once. An example would be that those end devices are connected to temperature sensors at different locations, so that the coordinator in the center can easily grab the data from different sensors.<br/><br/>
				Before we jump into the setup of above two networks, let's take a look on other possibilities of Network setup.
				</p>

				<figure><img height="300" src="http://xbee.wikispaces.com/file/view/Xbee_CLST.jpg/175627037/Xbee_CLST.jpg" alt="Baixiao Tree Network">
				<caption>Source: wikispaces.com</caption>
				</figure>

				<p>This is a Tree network. What is different from previous two is that it has a router, which is basically a relay that extends the range of network. In this graph, physical distance between end devices and coordinator may be out of xBee radio range; to solve this, we add a rounter in between, acting as a relay to grab data from end devices and transfer it to coordinator.<br/><br/>
				Also, we can even construct more complicated Mesh Network
				</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">xBee Pair Network Setup</h2>
				<p>Here is a list of materials we need before we could set up the xBee</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2x xBee modules: we need at least two to talk to each other</li>
					<li>1 <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11812" target="_blank">xBee explorer</a>: used to read and write data to xBee module</li>
					<li>Download XCTU software: software used to interfacing xBee explorer</li>
					<li>1 Arduino</li>
					<li>1 PC</li>
					<li>1 xBee shield (recommended)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So let's pair two xBees up and let them talk.</br>
				Plug your xBee to explorer, connect explorer to computer and launch the XCTU software.
				</p>

				<figure>
				<img width="100%" src="../images/tutorials_page/add_module.gif" alt="Baixiao add module">
				</figure>

				<p>There are some setting you need to change to make create pair network. You will see Channel, Pan ID, DH, DL, MY; these should be configured<br/><br/>
				<em>Channel:</em>This select which frequency or channel xBee will be using. xBee operates at roughly 2.4GHz, but with different channel, the frequency varies a little bit. So two xBees need to be set to the same channel (or frequency) before they can talk to each other.<br/><br/>
				<em>PAN ID:</em> It stands for Personal Area Network. It defines in which network a xBee resides. Thus you need to put all xBees inside the <strong>same</strong> network to let them talk. You can defines the number vary from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF in hexadecimal.<br/><br/>
				<em>MY</em>: The address of currently selected xBee module. It serves as an ID number for your xBee.<br/><br/>
				<em>DL,DH</em>: This two defines the destination address (or MY address) of xBee you are talking to.
				Normally, you need to set the DH to 0 and DL to the MY address of destination xBee.<br/><br/>
				</p>
				<p>Lets go ahead and change the value of first xBee:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Channel: set to C (whatever you want as long as it is the same with the other xBee)</li>
					<li>Pan ID: set to 1234 (actually whatever you want as long as it is with the range)</li>
					<li>DH: set to zero</li>
					<li>DL: set to 1001 (MY address of the other xBee)</li>
					<li>MY: set to 1000</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Then set up the other xBee exactly the same way except that DL and MY value of the other xBee are swapped. Then you are done, you make two xBees to be a pair network!<br/>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Channel: set to C (whatever you want as long as it is the same with the other xBee)</li>
					<li>Pan ID: set to 1234 (actually whatever you want as long as it is with the range)</li>
					<li>DH: set to zero</li>
					<li>DL: set to 1000 (MY address of the previous xBee)</li>
					<li>MY: set to 1001</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Wiring for xBee and Arduino</h2>
				<p>
				You can keep one of the xBee plugged to the explorer and computer, because we will send data from the computer. And then plug the other xBee to xBee shield, which is in turn plugged to Arduino.<br/>
				It looks like this: 
				</p>
				<figure width="70%">
					<img alt="arduino with shield" src="http://playground.arduino.cc/uploads/Shields/XBeeBoard03_2.jpg">
					<caption>Source: playground.arduino.cc</caption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					If you don't have xBee shield, you can hook up xBee with arduino with minimum wiring.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img alt="xBee minimum wiring" width="100%" src="../images/tutorials_page/xbeeMinimumWiring.png">
				</figure>
				<p>
					So the wiring is pretty easy. You simply connect the xBee power pin (pin 1) to 3.3 volt (not 5V) supply of arduino, and xBee ground (pin 10) to Arduino ground. As for data wire, you connect Data Out pin of xBee (pin 2) to the TX pin of arudino and Data In pin (pin 3) to the RX pin. This enables Arduino to read and write data with xBee through serial communication.
				</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Teach Arduino talk with xBee</h2>
				<p>
					No hardwork so far, just simple setup. Now we are going to code the arduino, teach him to talk!<br/>
					As I have metioned, Arduino interfaces with xBee through <strong>Serial Communication</strong>.
					Thus, we do not need any external library to talk to xBee, sweet! Arduino serial reads data from RX pin and send data through TX pin, so we only need to figure out how to send data through those two pins. So let's jump into the code.
				</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-c">
void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
  if(Serial.available()){
    Serial.print("I Got: ");
    Serial.println(Serial.readStringUntil('\n'));
  }
}
</pre>

			<p>
				This looks very familiar, if you have used Serial Monitor on Arduino IDE before.<br/>
				Yes, Serial in the code segment can deal with the communication with either USB connection 
				or Tx Rx pins. It works the same way as you would talk to arduino through USB.
				But in this case, serial connection is bridged between Arduino and xBee instead of between Arduino 
				and Serial monitor.<br/><br/>
				Alright, let's look at what does the code do. In every loop of program, arduino check if there is 
				any data available from xBee it connected to. If there are incomming data, then arduino reads the 
				data from the xBee, and appends that data to "I Got: " string and sends the message back to xBee. So
				that the xBee will send the data to another xBee connected to the computer.<br/>
				Notice that Serial.readStringUntil('\n') reads a line from data stream; Read is complete only when 
				Arduino encounters newline character, which is '\n'.
				<br/><br/>
			</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle">Let's try sending data from PC</h2>
			<p>Remember that the other xBee is plugged to computer through xBee explorer? We are going to send data 
			through that xBee. No coding in this part, just open XCTU and connect to the explorer as we did before. 
			Click on the monitor tab on upper right of screen, allowing you to send data through a monitor.<br/>
			Type hello. Then you will see "hello" in blue (characters in blue represent sent data) and you will also 
			get back "I Got: hello" in red (characters in red represent received data).
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img width="100%" alt="XCTU send data" src="../images/tutorials_page/XCTU_sendData.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				If you reach this point, you have successfully sent data to the Arduino, which is "hello", through 
				your pc to the Arduino and successfully received the data from the Arduino, which is "I Got: hello"!
